##The Privacy Debate
As I hope many of you are aware there recently has been a growing debate about our privacy when using electronic
 / modern telecommunications technology. A lot of this debate surrounds [Edward Snowden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden)
 and the [NSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency), however I do not want to attempt to
 force feed you my point of view. I agree with the words of NSA Deputy Director [Richard Ledgett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ledgett)
 when he said, (in [this TED talk regarding NSA surviellence programs](http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_ledgett_the_nsa_responds_to_edward_snowden_s_ted_talk))
 that the best thing we can all do is to, "learn the facts." 

####Some informative TED talks
* As linked above, [this](http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_ledgett_the_nsa_responds_to_edward_snowden_s_ted_talk) talk
actually features Richard Ledgett live answering questions at a [TED](http://www.ted.com/) conference.

* [This](http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_how_the_nsa_betrayed_the_world_s_trust_time_to_act) is a talk given in
 Brussels in which Cybersecurity Expert [Mikko Hypponen](http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_how_the_nsa_betrayed_the_world_s_trust_time_to_act)
 brings up some excellent points about what these actions (primarily those made by the NSA) mean for us as a
 modern population.

* [This](http://www.ted.com/talks/edward_snowden_here_s_how_we_take_back_the_internet) talk features Edward Snowden
 himself live via robot and webcam, and offers insight into his intentions with the leak, as well as his take on
 some of the programs he uncovered. Also, some talk as to what he believes are the next steps.

More to come....
