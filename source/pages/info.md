##The Privacy Debate
As I hope many of you are aware there recently has been a growing debate about our privacy when using electronic
 / modern telecommunications technology. A lot of this debate surrounds [Edward Snowden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden)
 and the [NSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency), however I do not want to attempt to
 force feed you my point of view. I agree with the words of NSA Deputy Director [Richard Ledgett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ledgett)
 when he said, (in [this TED talk regarding NSA surviellence programs](http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_ledgett_the_nsa_responds_to_edward_snowden_s_ted_talk))
 that the best thing we can all do is to, "learn the facts."

####Some TED talks
* As linked above, [this](http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_ledgett_the_nsa_responds_to_edward_snowden_s_ted_talk) talk
actually features Richard Ledgett live answering questions at a [TED](http://www.ted.com/) conference.

* [This](http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_how_the_nsa_betrayed_the_world_s_trust_time_to_act) is a talk given in
 Brussels in which Cybersecurity Expert [Mikko Hypponen](http://www.ted.com/talks/mikko_hypponen_how_the_nsa_betrayed_the_world_s_trust_time_to_act)
 brings up some excellent points about what these actions (primarily those made by the NSA) mean for us as a
 modern population.

* [This](http://www.ted.com/talks/edward_snowden_here_s_how_we_take_back_the_internet) talk features Edward Snowden
 himself live via robot and webcam, and offers insight into his intentions with the leak, as well as his take on
 some of the programs he uncovered. Also, some talk as to what he believes are the next steps.

####Words from others on this subject

* [A great video](http://media.libreplanet.org/u/zakkai/m/free-software-for-freedom-surveillance-and-you/) from
[Jacob Appelbaum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Appelbaum) featured at [LibrePlanet 2014](https://libreplanet.org/2014/)
about the surviellence breaks, and how free and open software and hardware plays into the surviellence issue and our future.
He also talks about what needs to change in free and open source software to become more mainstream, and allow us to break free of
these monitored centralized systems.

####Related

* A very upsetting [article](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/obama-zero-day/) that shows the major mindset issue that helped lead to
the NSA scandal in the first place and now is only making things worse. Note that the Presidentâ€™s Review Group on Intelligence and
Communications Technologies released a [report](http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/White-House-NSA-Panel-Report-2013.pdf)
in which it took a much more logical angle on this sensitive issue.

* [Prism-Break](https://prism-break.org/) is a really cool website that offers free replacements for proprietary software that aims to better
your security.

<small>I recently wrote a research paper on this topic as part of my Ethics in Computing (ISTE-110) class at RIT. So expect
this section to grow a lot as I transfer what I believe to be the critical information here.</small>

##Awesome Open-source Projects
* [OpenSpritz](https://github.com/Miserlou/OpenSpritz)
    * If you don't know about [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) you should check it out. It's incredible. But this project
    isn't Spritz, it's just a nice reminder of why I love the open-source community. OpenSpritz is an open-source rendition
    of the Spritz software written in Javascript. For more information read the [blog post](https://gun.io/blog/openspritz-a-free-speed-reading-bookmarklet/)
    by the original author, or check out the [Github project page](https://github.com/Miserlou/OpenSpritz).

* [Popcorn Time](https://github.com/popcorn-team/popcorn-app)
    * Popcorn time is another just incredible project. It allows you to stream movies using the power of [BitTorrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent),
    and it is just soooooo cool. I hope to see forks (if not help out on those forks) for watching TV shows, or listening
    to music.

* [iOS Onion Browser](https://github.com/mtigas/iOS-OnionBrowser)
    * I love [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) and of course I love open-source so when I found out that the Onion Browser
    for iOS was open source I was thrilled. Putting the power of TOR onto iOS (not even just jailbroken iOS) is something I believe
    is almost necessary, not to mention really cool. You can check out the [offical site here](https://mike.tig.as/onionbrowser/).
