I believe that words and language often restricts the ability of our minds to fully express our thoughts and feelings.
However, from time to time I stumble upon an arrangement of words that I feel nears the true
capacity of what the speaker had in mind. This page is for those such words.

And sometimes quotes are just plain funny.
